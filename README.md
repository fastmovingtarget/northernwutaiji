# Welcome to fastmovingtarget's Tai-Chi website readme!

# The Problem:
- I studied Northern Wu Taiji for a long time but never found a truly useful tutorail/information/booking website.
- So I'm gonna make one.

## MVP
- Routes to forms, applications, foundation, QiGong and background information.
- Videos for forms, applications.

## MS1
- Broken down videos, explanations.
- Visuals and transitions between pages.

## MS2
- Booking form and user authentication.
- Levelling and ranks.

## MS3
- Tutorial aids - foot movement tracker (library?)

# Practices
## Time management and planning:
- Trying to keep track of what I'm doing every hour and logging it into the journal.
- Strict deadline - I want to be finished with development by the end of the week, so 24/01/2025.

## Development and testing
- Not going out of my way to learn any new technology, just want to assess speed and capabilities.
- Prioritise Test Driven Development.
